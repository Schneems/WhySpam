<p>Hey You Guys</p>

<p>This is a super duper example of what someone might send, this is only=
 text/html, but this way i know i ain't accidentally making recursive cal=
ls. If you're getting this and weren't expecting it, please call Richard =
Snowman, cause he's sending this using an automated ruby mailer, and prob=
ably did something wrong, and you will continue to get random emails, unt=
il he fixes it. So long and thanks for all the fish.
