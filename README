Site is down due to repeated abuse of the mail server. Feel free to fork this project or to take code snippets from it to build your own email tools.

The site will remain up for another month though it will not be able to send or receive email. You can still check existing emails in the database. If you had any important email communication routing through our servers, please update any email addresses pointing to our servers to other email addresses.

==== Whyspam Me ===
 
Whyspam Me is a spam accountability and email anonymizing application originally written by Richard Schneeman.

For more information on what that means go to http://www.whyspam.me and watch our video. 

Our main defense against spammers is the disposable email system. A user gives our web-app an email, and gets a disposable email back. The user then gives that disposable email out to websites and we can track who spams and who doesn't without the user ever risking personal information. 



==== Application  Flow ====
When a user fills out the form on the index page, a user object is created where the user name is random, the login is the personal email address and the password is the personal email address. This user object is then assigned a Whymail object that contains a disposable email. When someone sends that disposable email a message it gets received by servers running running postfix and courier on a Ubuntu.

Every so often the Whyspam application get the emails into my application by running:

rake mailbox:check

This creates a fetcher daemon and makes sure the daemon is re-spawned if ever killed. Once the email is in the web-app the email object is sent to the receive method of the MyMailer model and a new ticket is created. This will fire the after_create callback for the ticket, which checks to see if there is a User that has a Whymail object that has the same disposable email. If that ticket has an associated Whymail address (disposable email address), then the body and subject are forwarded to the private personal user's inbox.
