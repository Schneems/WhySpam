Do you like spam? 

Didn't think so...

WhySpam is an opensource set of tools online tools to fight spam. Plain an simple. If you care about fighting spam, and saving pandas, then download the code, replace config/database.yml, config/environments/development.rb, and config/mailer_daemon.yml
 and you're up and running.

 To start using the mail fetcher, run:

sudo god -c ./config/fetcher-daemon.god -D

Then start your server: script/server

Navigate to http://localhost:3000 and read the directions, if you have any comments, thoughts, or criticisms...let me know. I need all sorts of help. From wording, and images, basic layout, to optimizing code, security, and maybe a little therapy.
