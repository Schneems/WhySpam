Version 5.0.3

NEW FEATURES AND FUNCTIONS:

* Fixed #26664: crash on service timeout or unmonitor action
  (introduced in 5.0.2). Thanks to Bretislav Kubesa and
  Michael Shigorin for report.

* Removed the configure --without-resource option. If the user
  who is running Monit doesn't have permissions to check the
  processes state, the related checks are disabled dynamically. 


Version 5.0.2

BUGFIXES:

* 35 improvements based on code scan with Klockwork
  (http://www.klocwork.com/) which we were evaluating.
  Huge thanks to Klocwork for their great product.

* Fixed #26382: if start or stop script for some service didn't
  exist, monit logged error during configuration file parsing and
  refused to start. Monit now just logs warning and continues.


Version 5.0.1

BUGFIXES:

* Fixed a bug where Monit did not stop logging succeeded events.
  This bug occurred if PID, PPID, timestamp or size change tests
  were used and failed and then succeeded again.


Version 5.0

NEW FEATURES AND FUNCTIONS:

* M/Monit support added. If you run Monit on more than one
  server, you can use M/Monit to manage and control all your
  Monit enabled servers from one simple Web Interface. See
  http://mmonit.com/ for details.

* Support use of symbolic links in filesystem check. Thanks to
  Aleksander Kamenik for suggestion. Example:
    check filesystem rootfs path 
         /dev/disk/by-uuid/4ef973f7-67d1-4bb0-8223-cb1c692b72e4
      if space usage > 95% then alert
      if inode usage > 95% then alert

* If no 'set mailserver' was defined in monitrc, Monit tried to
  fallback to localhost:25 SMTP server. This fallback was removed
  since it may be confusing. If you want to deliver mail alerts
  from Monit, the 'set mailserver' option is necessary. In case
  it is missing, Monit will log appropriate error and hint to add
  it.

* The generic send/expect protocol test limited the expect input
  to 256 bytes. It's possible to set the input buffer for expect
  globally - for example: set expectbuffer 20 kb Thanks to Asil
  Carlin for suggestion.

* The following event types were added CONTENT, FSFLAGS, PID and
  PPID and the following generic event types CHANGED and MATCH were
  removed and replaced by the above types and with the existing SIZE,
  CHECKSUM, TIMESTAMP events so the information is more specific
  The event types are internal to Monit and unless you have used
  either CHANGED or MATCH event in your alert filters, no change
  is necessary (alerts are delivered as usual, the tests just use
  different types internally).
  
* Monit now generates a unique id on first start and store the id
  in a permanent file. This id is used in protocol communication
  between Monit and M/Monit to pair a Monit instance with it's
  host entry in M/Monit. By default the id file is placed in
  $HOME/.monit.id. The location can be changed by using the set
  idfile statement, for example:
    set idfile /var/monit.id

* Monit now keep its service monitoring state even on Monit
  restart. Previously Monit dropped the state when it was stopped
  correctly. Services in manual monitoring mode will remember the
  monitoring state across Monit restarts. If Monit is used in a
  cluster, it is recommended to place the state file in a
  temporary filesystem incase the primary machine will crash and
  the the spare machine takeover, the state will be dropped on
  reboot for the crashed machine and the services in manual
  monitoring mode won't be started on reboot. For example the
  "set statefile /tmp/monit.state" can be used to place the state
  file in the /tmp/ filesystem.

* Added a protocol test for testing the LMTP protocol. Thanks
  to Fco. Javier Felix for patch.

* Added the start delay option for daemon statement which allows
  to pause Monit on its startup for a while. If monitored
  services are started by init scripts in parallel on system
  boot, Monit may be too fast and detect that the service is not
  running (yet) and restart the service. Note that it's still
  recommended Monit is setup to be responsible for service
  startup (that is, don't use init to start Monit controlled
  services, instead use Monit). This will ensure correct startup
  without need for a start delay since Monit will have full
  control of service startup. Many users start services from init
  on boot anyway, so in such cases this option will solve their
  problems. Default start delay is 0 which corresponds to the
  current behavior. Example syntax which will make Monit wait one
  minute before starting its first monitoring cycle:
  --8<--
    set daemon 5 with start delay 60
  --8<--
  Thanks to Fco. Javier Felix for patch.

* Added PAM support for Monit http interface authentication. Note
  that PAM is not supported on all platforms - currently works on
  Linux, Mac OS X, FreeBSD, NetBSD. Monit uses the PAM service "monit".
  Here is a Monit PAM service example for Mac OS X which is able
  to authenticate system users for Monit access -
  /etc/pam.d/monit:
  --8<--
    # monit: auth account password session
    auth       sufficient     pam_securityserver.so
    auth       sufficient     pam_unix.so
    auth       required       pam_deny.so
    account    required       pam_permit.so
  --8<--
  And configuration for monitrc which allows only group admins
  to access the http interface:
  --8<--
    set httpd port 2812 allow @admin
  --8<--
  See the PAM manual page for details on how to configure the PAM
  service on your system and the available PAM plugins. Thanks to
  Wilhelm Meier for patch.

* Added more detailed reports for Monit resource tests on service
  recovery. Thanks to Lars Kotthoff for patch.

* Set locale to C.

* Added a protocol test for testing the SIP protocol which is
  used by popular communication servers such as Asterisk and
  FreeSWITCH. We received two patches for this protocol and have
  taken code from both and merged them. Many thanks to Bret 
  McDanel and to Pierrick Grasland for supplying the patches.

* Added MONIT_DESCRIPTION to the list of environment variables
  available to programs started by monit. Thanks to Morten 
  Bressendorff Schmidt for patch.

* If a service group is specified for Monit CLI action,
  Monit no longer requires the "all" verb, so the following
  command is possible:
    monit -g web stop
  If group is not specified (i.e. the -g option is omitted), the
  service name or "all" is still required as a safeguard.

* Added an option to the 'set mailserver' statement so it is
  possible to override the hostname used in SMTP EHLO/HELO and in
  the Message-ID header when sending mail. Monit defaults to use
  the localhost name. I.e. what you get when executing this
  command 'uname -n'. Overriding the host name can be useful if
  the host does not have a DNS entry and if the receiving
  mailserver uses DNS verification as spam protection. The new
  override option is:
  set mailserver foo.bar.baz using hostname "my.monit.host"

* A new EVENT_ACTION type was added which reports actions
  performed on Monit's administrator request (either via web
  interface or CLI). If you don't want to received these events,
  you can set the mail-filter for "action" event type.

* NOTA BENE: Monit start action is synchronous now. This improves
  the startup sequence for dependent services, since Monit will
  wait for parent service to start before trying to start the
  child.

* It is now possible to define execution timeout for start and
  stop commands. That is, how long Monit will wait after
  executing a command before it assume execution failed. If the
  timeout option is omitted, Monit defaults to 30 seconds. You
  can override the timeout for example for services which are
  starting slower.
  Example syntax:
    start program = "/bin/foo start" with timeout 60 seconds

* The event passed state is renamed to succeeded as this name
  more reflects the state of things.

* The device service test is renamed to filesystem.

BUGFIXES:

* Some linux virtualization platforms report CPU count as 0.
  Monit then dynamically disabled CPU usage monitoring. In such
  case we now override the CPU count from 0 to 1 so resource
  usage monitoring can continue. Thanks to Jenny Hopkins for
  report.

* Increased the server socket backlog queue which will make Monit
  able to handle more services. Thanks to Jochen Kramer.

* Fixed #24866: Email messages such as: cpu wait usage check
  succeeded [current cpu wait usage=17.4%] were displayed as
  "...usage<SOMEGARBAGE>.4%". The problem was incorrect transfer
  encoding header in the email (the body itself was OK). Thanks
  to Dave Cheney for report.

* When a Monit shutdown requested was issued while Monit were
  working and testing services, Monit did not shutdown until all
  work were done, i.e. until all services were tested. Monit will
  now shutdown faster - as soon as it finish testing the current
  service.

* Monit blocked/unblocked SIGTERM, SIGINT SIGHUP and SIGUSR1
  signals during operation to protect certain code sections. When
  a signal was sent during such a time, for example to stop
  Monit, it was dropped and had to be retried in order to stop
  Monit. This limitation is now removed and signals will be
  processed at any time. Thanks to Nicola Tiling for report.

* If the Monit httpd allow option did not include a
  user:password, Monit CLI logged the following error (even if
  the action was performed anyway):
     Cleartext credentials needed for basic authorization!
  This error was false - even access restriction based on
  host/net is sufficient - user and password is just one of
  possible options (not requirement). Thanks to Gilad Benjamini
  for report.

* Allow localhost as a value for the host header in the http
  protocol test instead of setting an empty host header and let
  the http server decide

* The 'if changed checksum ...' test can now be used even if a
  monitored file doesn't exist at Monit startup. Thanks to Joe
  Shang for report.

* If both event handlers (M/Monit and mail alerts) temporarily
  failed at once and event queue was enabled, events will be
  stored in the queue and delivered in the next cycle. However, a
  bug caused delivery to be retried for every cycle for both
  handlers if just one of them was recovered. Monit could then
  deliver the same message multiple times until both handlers
  recovered. The problem is now fixed and only one copy of the
  event is sent even if only one handler did recover.

* Make unit in size test optional and default to byte unless
  specified. So it is possible to write, if size > 1000 then ..

* Fixed handling of invalid input files in event queue handler.
  Thanks to Fco.Javier Felix for patch.

* Set the content type to text/html for Monit web interface POST
  responses. Thanks to Rich Drummond for patch.

* Fixed #23530: configure script will return error if bison,
  byacc or yacc are not found at Monit compile time.

* Fix CPU and memory monitoring on Solaris (it was disabled on
  Monit start)

* AIX fixes and extensions, Monit should run on AIX without
  problems, including cpu, memory and filesystem monitoring
  (tested with AIX 5.3). Thanks to Brian Downey for support
  and help.

* HP-UX fixes and extensions, Monit should run on HP-UX without
  problems, including cpu, memory and filesystem monitoring.
  Thanks to Brian Downey for support and help.

* Fixed #23467: Don't exit, only issue a warning if the "include"
  statement did not find any files to include.

* Fixed #23530: Event queue did not work with the default
  unlimited slots.

* Fixed #23617: The process cpu usage is initializing in the
  first cycle so the value is set to 0% - if the 'cpu usage <
  xyz%' test was used to check that the process usage is higher
  then given level, it was always true. Monit now skips the
  process cpu usage check in the first cycle.

* Make sure Monit alerts has a unique message id. Thanks to Steve
  Purcell for report

* Fixed possible crash when Monit is watching VPS environment on
  Linux which reports number of CPUs as 0. Thanks to Marius
  Schmidt for report.

* Cleanup event states during a service stop/unmonitor so old 
  events are not sent when the service is started/monitored again.

* Fixed #21989: Monit could start two instances of the process
  when service restart is performed and the process is starting
  slowly. Thanks to Nick Upson, Aaron Scamehorn and David Greaves
  for report.

* Fixed #21550: Fix crash when Monit event queue contained an
  empty file. Thanks to Douglas J Hunley for report.

* Fixed possible crash when the 'if changed checksum' test was
  used along with restart action. Thanks to Brian Candler for
  report.

* Fixed #22075: Allow using a mail address as username when using
  SMTP authentication.

* Fixed #22191 and #19823: If the file content test does not match
  anymore, reset the service error state. (Previous versions did 
  not clear the error state and kept showing a match in the status
  listing and in the http interface).

* The 'if changed size ...' test can now be used even if the
  monitored file does not exist on monit's start.

* If a htpasswd file is used to control Monit http interface
  access and the hash type is set to MD5 but the file contains
  wrong format (non-MD5), report the error and keep running.
  Formerly Monit exited with an assert exception. Thanks to
  Adrian Bridgett for report.

BACKWARD INCOMPATIBLE CHANGES:
* The current CPU usage test which checked the cpu usage of the
  process itself plus the cpu usage of child processes was
  renamed to TOTALCPU (otherwise it works the same). The new CPU
  usage test checks the CPU usage of the process itself only.
  This change was introduced to align the syntax with MEMORY and
  TOTALMEMORY tests and to allow to test the CPU usage of
  processes which fork child processes but the user don't want to
  include children (such as Mythtv). Users who are using the CPU
  check for services like Apache webserver to watch total cpu
  utilization (including children) should rename the CPU
  statement in their configuration to TOTALCPU.


Version 4.10.1

BUGFIXES:
* Monit reported wrongly that an alert handler failed. This bug 
  was introduced in monit-4.10.

* Fixed memory usage report on machines with more then 4GB
  physical memory running Mac OS X. Thanks to Dave Cheney for
  patch.


Version 4.10

NEW FEATURES AND FUNCTIONS:
* Monit from this version on is licensed under GPL version 3

* Added support for SMTP authentication and SSL for sending alerts.
  Example syntax:
  - plain authentication:
    set mailserver
      smtp.foo.bar username "user" password "secret"
  - plain authentication with ssl:
    set mailserver
      smtp.foo.bar username "user" password "secret" using sslv3
  - plain authentication with tls:
    set mailserver
      smtp.foo.bar username "user" password "secret" using tlsv1
  Thanks to Thomas Lohmueller for patch.

* Allow to set the location of monitrc using the 'configure --sysconfdir'
  option during Monit compilation. Thanks to Klaus Heinz for patch.

* Monit now log user action, requested via monit's http interface.

* Monit http interface now use POST method for forms
  (This change is transparent from the users point of view).

* Monit ICMP echo/ping test now supports 20 echo requests per cycle at
  maximum.

* When Monit identifies a process as zombie, it continue monitoring
  the process (formerly Monit disabled monitoring of the given service
  and sent an alert since it was considered unmanageable).    

* Fixed #21447: Monit now adds a (dummy) Message-id header in alert 
  mails to prevent spam checkers to accidentally filter out Monit 
  alerts based on missing message-id.

* Removed C99 particulars from Monit code to support non-C99 compilers.

REMOVED FEATURE
* Removed support for local redirects in the HTTP protocol test. Users
  must provide the correct path for the resource they want to test.

BUGFIXES:
* Fixed a possible Monit crash on exit if a match rule was used and
  referred a file containing multiple expressions. Thanks to Stephen
  Dowdy for report.

* Added patch from Klaus Heinz which fix a problem in the Log module 
  that had Monit using an uninitialized mutex after a monitrc reload.

* Fixed a possible crash on Monit start when the Monit control file
  contained exec action with argument longer then 256 bytes. Thanks
  to Stevan Bajic for report.

* Fixed linux 32-bit system CPU usage statistics (the fix in 4.9 was
  incomplete). If a server had a long/large uptime and high load, the 
  reported CPU usage could be incorrect. Thanks to Aleksander for report.

* Fixed a problem where Monit would incorrect display an error in the 
  web interface status page. This could occur if a service had failed, 
  Monit had reload and the state of the service had succeeded just after the
  reload (for example due to changes of the configuration rules). Thanks to
  Claus Klein for report and help with the patch.

* Avoid filling the log with "pidfile does not contain a valid pidnumber"
  entries during debug

* Added patch from Dave Cheney, which fix and reactivate resource testing 
  for Mac OS X Tiger (Darwin 10.4.x). 

* Fix memory leak when regular expression is used in Monit configuration
  and Monit is reloaded. Thanks to Josh Kelley for patch.

* Allow the "if changed timestamp" test to refer to a non-existing file.
  This could be useful if the service is monitored in non-active mode
  and the file is expected to be created later.

* When 'if match' statement was used with the path to the regex file
  containing more then one line and the exec action was used for this
  rule, then Monit failed to parse the configuration and refused to start.
  Thanks to Nathan for report.

* contrib/wap.php updated. Thanks to David Fletcher.        

* Fixed #21354: Usage of the IMAP Protocol test was impossible due to a small
  typo in the control file parser and the test would fall back to DEFAULT. 
  Thanks to Wolfgang Breyha for reporting the bug.


Version 4.9

NEW FEATURES AND FUNCTIONS:
* The NOALERT statement added, which allows to disable the
  alerts local for particular recipient and service. Useful
  for example when you have alert recipient set globaly
  but don't want to receive alerts for some part of services.
  Syntax:
      noalert <mail-address>

* The ALERT statement was extended by the possibility to
  negate the optional event filter. 
  Syntax:
      [set] alert <mail-address> not '{' <event>... '}'
  Example:
    set alert user1@domain but not on { restart }
    Will send all alerts to user1@domain for all services and
    events except the restart event. Note that noise words
   'but' and 'on' are optional.

* Report the optional arguments uid, gid, method timeout as
  configured in Monit control file for start, stop programs
  and exec action.

* Monit will display just warning and will continue its
  startup in the case that some hostname which is configured
  in Monit control file is not resolvable during control
  file parsing.

* Reverse proxy support on Monit http interface added. Thanks   
  to Josh Kelley for patch. Sample proxy configuration for      
  Apache:       
  --8<--        
  ProxyPass /monit/ http://localhost:2812/      
  ProxyPassReverse /monit/ http://localhost:2812/       
  <Location /monit/>    
    AllowOverride None          
    AuthType Basic      
    AuthName sysadmin   
    AuthUserFile /etc/httpd/passwd      
    require valid-user          
  </Location>   
  --8<--

* When the filesystem doesn't support inodes, then the
  related information is not displayed in Monit http
  interface in red font anymore (it highlighted this
  informational state inappropriately). Thanks to
  Aleksander for suggestion.

BUGFIXES:
* Fix the unmonitor action, which didn't work when used in
  Monit control file rules. Thanks to Jeffrey Gelens for report.

* Fix the extra restart action which was called by monit
  in addition to user requested start action of stopped
  process. This didn't occurred in the case that the 'every'
  statement was used on the service definition as well. Thanks
  to Aaron Scamehorn for help.

* Fix the possible crash when event queue was used and some
  non-event file appeared the event queue. Thanks to Michal
  Cihar for report.

* Fix the -l command line option which was broken. Thanks to
  Aaron Scamehorn for report.

* Fix the linux 32-bit system CPU usage statistics. When
  the server has big uptime and load, the reported cpu usage
  may be incorrect. Thanks to Ron Avriel for patch, Matt
  Corks and Aleksander for report.

* Fix the Mac OS X CPU usage statistics.

* Fix the Linux space usage statistics - the NFS volumes
  space usage statistic was wrong. Thanks to Aaron Scamehorn
  for help.

* The UDP port test for all nondefault protocols, such as NTP,
  DNS now measures the response time without extra 2 seconds
  delay, which was added by generic check for UDP socket
  readiness. When the non-default protocol is used in port test,
  (i.e. 'protocol' option is used) this check is not needed.
  When you will use the UDP port test without specifying the
  protocol, the 2 seconds delay is still present, since when
  Monit don't know how to speak to the server, it's hard to
  test the UDP other way.

* Fix the possible crash for Mac OS X Monit CLI commands such
  as 'monit start service'.

* Fix possible crash on Monit quit when Monit http thread was
  configured in control file without the ACL. Thanks to Adam
  Greene for report.

* Fix the Monit crash when byacc was used for compiling 32-bit
  Monit with large files support on linux. This issue didn't
  happened when Monit was compiled with 64-bit support, or
  recommended bison was used as parser generator during
  compilation, or largefiles support was disabled.

* Don't ask clients for certificate when certificate based
  authentication was not enabled in Monit http interface.
  Thanks to Guillaume Chaussy for report.

* Fix minor memory leaks.

* Don't print the 'via (UDP|TCP|TCPSSL)' for unix socket test
  trace.


Version 4.8.2

NEW FEATURES AND FUNCTIONS:
* Added a filesystem flags change test. This test is implicit
  for the 'device' service type and Monit will now send an 
  alert by default if flags were changed. This is useful for 
  example, if the filesystem has been remounted read-only, if 
  there are disk errors or if mount flags (e.g. nosuid) were 
  changed. It is possible to override the default (alert) 
  action by using this test:
    if changed fsflags [ratio] then <action>

* Added Clamav protocol test by Debrard Sebastien
  (sebastien debrard at strange-garden com)

BUGFIXES:
* Improved the Monit http interface responsiveness on action
  scheduling.
  
* The SMTP protocol test now sends EHLO or HELO first when 
  testing the SMTP protocol as per RFC 2821. Thanks to Kevin 
  Maguire for bug report.

* Fixed the Mac OS X 10.4.x / Darwin 8.x build and implemented
  'process memory usage' monitoring on this platform.

* Fixed build on NetBSD 3.x

* Fixed cpu usage statistics on Linux.

* Fixed warnings logged on solaris when the ssh protocol test
  was used to test Sun's version of sshd.

* Fixed handling of >2GB files by using the Large File Support
  API on platforms supporting this API. Thanks to Will Bryant
  (will bryant at ecosm com) for providing a patch. 

* Fixed the possible monitoring state amnesia when Monit was
  reloading just after the the service monitoring state was
  changed. Thanks to Morten Laursen for report.


Version 4.8.1

BUGFIXES:
* Fix the RHEL4 x86-64 related crash in logging introduced
  in 4.8. This problem may probably occur on other Opteron
  based platforms as well. Thanks to Mike Jackson
  ( mjackson mightymerchant , com ) for report and helping
  with the patch. This fix should also apply to 64-bit PPC
  platforms as well.

* Don't stop if there is no space on the filesystem where
  the Monit state file is placed. Thanks to Pavel Urban
  (urbanp at mlp ,cz> for report.

* Remove the false warning about TOTALMEMORY statement on
  linux.


Version 4.8

NEW FEATURES AND FUNCTIONS:

* Added PostgresSQL protocol test by Tatsuya Nonogaki 
  (nonotats at asahi email ne jp)

* Removed a feature introduced in 4.7 which tested that a
  check-file, check-directory or check-fifo actually refereed
  to an existing object of that type. Monit should not require
  these file objects to exist at startup.

* monit.spec file added to the distribution - it is now possible
  to build rpm package directly from the archive using:
  'rpmbuild -ta monit-<version>.tar.gz'
  
* Do not include [:port] in a HTTP host header protocol test
  if connection is against the standard HTTP port number. Some
  http servers or server-side programs may inappropriately
  respond with a redirect request if port number is included.

* The message priority support added for the logging output.
  Standard syslog priorities are used based on the context:
    emergency
    alert
    critical
    error
    warning
    notice
    info
    debug

BUGFIXES:

* Fix the presentation of the Leap Indicator field in NTP protocol test.
  Thanks to Janusz Krzysztofik ( jkrzyszt tis ! icnet ! pl ) for report
  and patch.

* Fix the event queue directory creation mode.

* Don't log the false alarm when event queue is enabled and there was
  no reason to create the spool directory yet

* Fix the parsing of include files when two joined consecutive include
  files looked as split configuration rule. Monit now assumes that each
  include file contains standalone statements and the rule cannot be
  split across several files. Thanks to Mike Pepe ( lamune doki - doki
  ! net ) for reporting the problem.
  
* Fixed a bug so that \0x00 bytes actually can be sent in a send statement.
  Previously, usage of \0x00 in a send string (of course) truncated the 
  string. Thanks to Morten Laursen ( MLA at rtx ! dk ) for reporting the
  problem.

* Ignore the process PID or PPID change when the service restart was
  performed under Monit control (the pid change is expected).

* Fix the support for PID and PPID change test custom event rate needed
  to trigger the action. Thanks to ( root at l8r net ) for report.


Version 4.7

NEW FEATURES AND FUNCTIONS:
*  Allow sending of non-printable bytes in send/expect statements.
   Use the hex notation, \0xHEXHEX to send any byte in the range 
   \0x00-\0xFF, that is, 0-255 in decimal. This may be useful
   when testing some network protocols, particularly those over UDP.
   To test for example a quake 3 server you can use the following,
      send "\0xFF\0xFF\0xFF\0xFFgetstatus"
      expect "sv_floodProtect|sv_maxPing"

*  Added system-wide resource check. Example:
     check system myhost
       if loadavg (1min) > 3.5 then alert
       if loadavg (5min) > 2 then alert
       if memory usage > 75% then alert
       if cpu usage (user) > 70% then alert
       if cpu usage (system) > 30% then alert
       if cpu usage (wait) > 20% then alert

*  Added fifo (named pipe) resource check. Example:
     check fifo qmgr-fifo with path /var/spool/postfix/public/qmgr
       if failed permission 622 then alert
       if failed uid postfix then alert
       if failed gid postdrop then alert

*  Added support for Oracle SQLNet protocol test. Monit can now ping
   Oracle server. Thanks to Artyom Khafizov < afk at inbox!ru >.
   Example usage:
     check host oracle with address 192.168.1.5
       if failed port 1521 protocol tns then alert

*  If the alert handler failed, e.g. because the mail server is down, 
   Monit can optionally add events to a queue and try to deliver pending 
   events at the next cycle or continue to try so until succeeded. To
   enable the event queue, use the 'set eventqueue' statement. Example:
     set eventqueue
       basedir /var/monit
       slots 5000

*  Send alerts when the Monit agent stopped, started or reloaded.

*  Monit now supports the event description macro $DESCRIPTION
   in the MAIL-FORMAT statement. It expands to the description
   of the error condition, which was originally placed under
   the default message body. The default message body now includes
   the new macro:
   --8<--
   $EVENT Service $SERVICE
  
        Date:        $DATE
        Action:      $ACTION
        Host:        $HOST
        Description: $DESCRIPTION
   
   Your faithful employee,
   monit
   --8<--

*  Cleanup of items obsoleted since Monit 4.0:
    - monit -i option was removed
    - $PROGRAM mail-format macro was removed (use $SERVICE macro)
    - CPUUSAGE statement was removed (use CPU statement).
    - MEMUSAGE statement was removed (use MEMORY statement).
    - MEMKBYTE statement was removed (use MEMORY statement).
    - 'TIMEOUT X Y' statement was removed (use
      'IF FAILED ... THEN TIMEOUT' statement).

BUGFIXES:
*  Re-implementation of the dependency sort algorithm to properly 
   support a directed acyclic graph (dag) structure of dependencies. 
   Thanks to Philipp Berndt <philipp berndt at gmx.net> for the patch.

*  If a file content test evaluate to true, Monit will now send an 
   alert each time. In previous versions, Monit only sent one alert
   on the first occurrence. Thanks to Peter Holik (peter AT holik!at)
   for reporting the problem.

*  Event logging and action handling optimized. Thanks to Peter Holik
   (peter AT holik!at) for testing and helping with the patch.

*  Added client_name field to the postfix-policy protocol test to
   support more policy server implementations. Thanks to Scott
   Storck < scott ; storck  topdeq ; com > for the patch.
   
*  Updated the socket network code to use a buffer when reading. 
   This should improve the speed and stability when reading from 
   a network connection.
   
*  Improved speed of several protocol tests. Previously Monit would
   hang on read until timeout seconds when testing some protocols. 
   Say thanks to Artyom Khafizov < afk at inbox!ru >.
   
*  Fixed a small bug that could cause send/expect to fail if more
   than one send/expect pair was used and the server sent a large
   response. Also fixed send/expect to work over UDP.

*  Monit now prints the socket type (TCP|TCPSSL|UDP) in the testing
   output.

*  Fixed the file size test.

*  Fixed the alert reminder option when combined with the 'on' option
   (events restriction) in one alert statement. Thanks to Rishikesh
   Dongre ( dongre $ globeop com ) for report.
   
*  Verify that the path used in a "check file" test actually points
   to a file and ditto with the "check directory" test

*  Fix the timestamp test when restart action was used. Thanks to
   Bretislav Kubesa ( webmaster at zippbrno ! cz ) for report and
   help.

*  Fix the cpu usage statistics on linux SMP systems.


Version 4.6

NEW FEATURES AND FUNCTIONS:
*  Added support for a Postfix SMTP access policy delegation 
   protocol test. Example of usage:
     check host policyd with address 192.168.1.5
       if failed port 10031 protocol postfix-policy then alert

*  Support for performing regular expression tests in text files 
   where added. Here's a teaser example showing how this feature
   can be used to scan syslog:
      check file syslog with path /var/log/syslog
         if match 
            "^\w{3} [ :0-9]{11} [._[:alnum:]-]+ mrcoffee\[[0-9]+\]:"
          # You can also collect regexs in a file 
          if match /etc/monit/active.regex then alert
   As shown, regex can be written directly in the control file or
   collected in a separate file which Monit will use. This feature
   depends on regex(7) and if not installed on the system, monit
   reverts to plain substring matching. The matching engine is 
   fast and on par with more specialized log-scanning tools.

*  Monit now sends three icmp echo requests in one cycle by default.
   It is also possible to customize the echo requests count using
   the count parameter of icmp test, for example:
     check host myserver with address 192.168.1.1
       if failed icmp type echo count 5 with timeout 3 seconds
       then alert

*  Support for optional error notification reminders. For those
   who wants to be notified several times that the service is still
   down, it is possible to specify the count of service failed cycles
   after which Monit will send another notification. The 'reminder'
   option was added to both local and global alert definitions - example:
     set alert foo@bar with reminder on 10 cycles
   will send error notification each tenth cycle when the service
   remains down. If you want to be notified on each cycle, use reminder
   on 1 cycle. Thanks to Pavel Urban <urbanp at mlp!cz> for suggesting
   the feature.

*  It is now possible to use the 'succeeded' keyword as alternative to the
   'recovered' keyword in a recovery action section.

*  Support for fault tolerant monitoring added. You can now specify 
   the event frequency before an action is conducted by monit. 
   In some cases you will want to allow a certain level of events to
   occur before an error is raised. This feature is optional and if
   not used, Monit defaults to act on the first event as usual. Both 
   failed and succeeded actions may be restricted this way. Here's an
   example:
     check host foo.bar with address 192.168.1.1
       if failed port 80 for 5 times within 8 cycles 
         then exec '/my/script'
       else if succeeded for 10 cycles then alert

BUGFIXES:
*  If kvm access on FreeBSD failed (for example because of environment
   restricted by virtual server), monit's process resource monitoring 
   will automatically be disabled. Thanks to Mike Jackson <mjackson at
   datahost!com> for reporting the problem.

*  Fixed the URL connection test. Monit now really tries to download 
   content length data from the HTTP server or if the content-length 
   header is not provided, up to 1 MB. Previous versions could fail 
   to read all the data provided by the server. Thanks to Ben 
   Hartshorne <ben at hartshorne!net> for reporting the problem.

*  Fixed CIDR notation of Monit http interface net allow option on
   little endian architectures.  Thanks to Ben Hartshorne <ben at
   hartshorne!net> for reporting the problem.

*  Retry service restart in the next cycle even if the stop method
   failed. Restart is now tried until the timeout limit is reached.
   Monit silently timed out the service if the stop method failed 
   (only an exec failed notification was sent). Thanks to Pavel Urban 
   <urbanp at mlp ! cz> for reporting the problem.
   
*  Close included config files after parsing. Previous versions of
   Monit kept parsed include files open, which could create a problem
   with unmount or removal of such files. Thanks to Martin Rueegg 
   <mrueegg at metaworx . ch> for reporting the problem.                     

*  Fix file checksum test with restart action. Thanks to Chris McKenzie
   ( chrismckenzie at hotmail ! com ) for reporting the problem.

*  Wait for complete SMTP server greeting in SMTP protocol test before
   sending QUIT to the server. Exim4 is sensible on the client-server
   synchronization and the protocol test failed because Monit was faster
   then expected. Thanks to Tadas Zelionis < tm at equs ! home ! lt >
   for reporting the bug.

*  Support the DOS end-of-line in the include statement of monit
   configuration file too. Thanks to Michael Shigorin <mike at osdn org ua>
   for reporting the problem.

*  Allow multi-line banner response from a SMTP server in the SMTP protocol
   test. Thanks to Sebastien Debrard <sebastien.debrard at strange-garden com>
   for reporting the problem.

*  Re-added the icmp ping vs. connection tests support. Now, if a ping test
   is defined for the host and it fails we simply do not continue with testing
   any port connection tests because we assume the line is down.

*  Fixed the echo request identification in ping test when more hosts were
   tested using the ping test. Thanks to Peter Holik ( peter AT holik!at )


Version 4.5.1

NEW FEATURES AND FUNCTIONS:
*  Support for native MySQL protocol test was added. The test can be 
   used with unixsocket and port testing rules. Example:
    check host FOO with address db.foo.bar
     if failed port 3306 protocol mysql then alert

*  Support for DNS protocol test added. The test can be used with
   port testing rules, either tcp or udp. Example:
    check host FOO with address ns.foo.bar
     if failed port 53 type udp protocol dns then alert

*  Status summary support added. The 'monit summary' command can be 
   used to obtain a quick overview of services handled by monit.
   Example output:
    The Monit daemon 4.5.1 uptime: 15m
    System 'foo'                        [0.16] [0.14] [0.09]
    Process 'slapd'                     running
    File 'slapd_bin'                    accessible
    Device 'rootfs'                     accessible
    Device 'vfatfs'                     Data access error
    File 'testfile'                     not monitored
    Remote Host 'bar'                   online with all services

BUGFIXES:
*  This release fix service timeout, which was broken in 4.5. Thanks to
   Waggott Graeme <gwaggott at ndsuk!com> for reporting the problem.


Version 4.5

NEW FEATURES AND FUNCTIONS:
*  New URL connection test. It is possible to use the URL notation
   when testing the HTTP protocol. The http protocol test is also
   changed to attempt to login using Basic authentication if the URL
   contains a username and password as shown below. In addition the
   http protocol test will follow redirect responses from the HTTP
   server. Finally the new URL test can be used to test the content
   returned by the server. POSIX regular expressions are supported in
   this test. Here's an example showing off the new URL test:

    check host FOO with address www.foo.bar
      if failed url https://user:password@www.foo.bar:8080/?query
         and content == 'action="j_security_check"'
      then ...

*  Added Monit daemon incarnation identification to Monit status.
   It is a unique number based on the Monit startup time and used
   for identifying Monit instances.

*  Added wap interface to Monit (available in contrib/wap.php).
   Thanks to David Fletcher <david at megapico!co!uk> for contributing
   the PHP-script.

*  Added apache-status protocol test contributed by David Fletcher,
   <david at megapico!co!uk>. If you use the Apache Httpd server and
   the mod_status module, this test may be useful since you can test
   the internals of Apache as reported by mod_status.

*  The Allow statement now accept additionally numeric networks in 
   IP/MASK syntax:
	allow 192.168.1.0/255.255.255.0
	allow 10.0.0.0/8

*  Added process PID change test. The test is implicit and Monit will
   send an alert by default if the pid was changed. It is possible to 
   override the default (alert) action by using this test;
	if changed pid then <action>

*  Added a process PPID (parent pid) change test. The test is implicit
   and Monit will send an alert by default. It is possible to override
   this default action by using this statement:
	if changed ppid then <action>

*  Internal control file language changes. The char '=' is promoted to
   a keyword and not longer ignored by monit. This change should be
   backward compatible and shouldn't affect existing control files.

*  Monit now looks for the control file monitrc in the directory
   /usr/local/etc/ in addition to the standard ~/, /etc/ and ./ 
   directories.

*  NetBSD support added

*  Added NTP version 3 protocol test contributed by Michel Marti
   <michel!marti at objectxp!com>.

*  Added support for Monit daemon wake-up via its http interface. This
   allows to remotely force a validation cycle start. The monit
   daemon wake-up may be called by using the "/_validate" url (there is 
   also a button for this action on the Monit http interface runtime page).
   Thanks to Leen Besselink <leen at wirehub!nl> for suggesting the
   feature.

BUGFIXES:
*  Fix total real memory usage statistics on Darwin.

*  Fix cpu usage statistics on Darwin.

*  Make the device space and inode usage statistics more accurate.
   Thanks M. D. Parker <mike!parker at ga!com> for reporting the
   problem and providing the patch.

*  Remove --without-accurate-mem-calcs and make it the default
   behavior. It appears that some of the info in the Linux 2.4
   kernel was suspect, and it's outright bogus in 2.6.

*  Fix process total memory usage (i.e process itself + children)
   monitoring. Thanks to Michel Marti <michel!marti at objectxp!com>
   for patch.

*  Fixed custom mailserver port definition in 'set mailserver X port Y'
   statement. Thanks to Pavel Urban <urbanp at mlp!cz> for reporting
   the problem.

*  Monit will reset service start and cycle counter on service unmonitor.
   Thanks to Einar S. Idso for reporting the problem.


Version 4.4

NEW FEATURES AND FUNCTIONS:
*  New --without-accurate-mem-calcs configure option. This option
   will, on Linux, cause usage of a faster, but less accurate memory
   calculations. The default is accurate.

*  "monit -H filename" or "monit -H < filename" prints the MD5/SHA1
   hash of the supplied file.

*  The SET MAILSERVER configure statement is extended to make it 
   possible to set a mail servers port number specifically. If not 
   used, the default port number is 25.

*  Refactoring of Monit HTTP interface's service state reporting.
   The state of any service's parameter is now reported by a red
   font in case of errors.

*  The Monit http server now presents data collected by the main
   thread's last check cycle - it will not anymore gather the data 
   itself. This makes the http request's response much faster and 
   consistent with what the main thread thinks about the services 
   status, on the other hand the presented data may be up to daemon 
   poll timeframe old.

*  Monitoring status now shows a 'initializing' value for services
   until data actually is collected. You can typically  see this state 
   before the first test cycle is finished and after monitoring was 
   enabled for given the service or immediately after Monit startup.

*  Display actual response time for ICMP Echo test in monit
   HTTP interface.

*  Display actual response time for port connection test in monit
   HTTP interface.

*  Display actual time-stamp for file and directory service page in monit
   HTTP interface.

*  New EVENT_ICMP type was added and ICMP related tests are now mapped
   to it. Previous version used a common EVENT_CONNECTION for both port 
   connections and for ICMP test types.

*  XML status are extended to report all service parameters and 
   system wide usage

*  Text status is extended to report all service parameters and 
   system wide usage

*  Add status data collection time-stamp

*  FreeBSD 5.x support added.

*  Added Mac OS X Startup Item for monit. You can find it in the 
   contrib directory. Thanks to Rick Robino <rrobino at wavedivision!com>

BUGFIXES:
*  Fixed assert in parser when using IF SIZE.  Thanks to  
   Andy <lists@automated.it> for reporting the problem.

*  Fixed race condition between threads during Monit reload.
   When a service stop was issued from the http interface during monit
   reload, a race condition and crash could occur. Monit will now not 
   anymore accept connections to its http interface during reload. 
   Thanks to Peter Holdaway <pholdaway at technocom-wireless!com> for 
   reporting the problem.

*  Fixed double free of memory in http engine which can lead to
   Monit stack corruption and freeze or crash of Monit during
   reload.

*  Fixed possible Monit crash on opteron based systems. Thanks to Hans
   Rauch <h!rauch at help!hessen!de> for reporting the problem.

*  Return the base status page URL in case an action was called
   via a service URL action parameter in monit's HTTP interface. This
   prevents unwanted action repetition in case of page refresh.

*  If a monitored file's or directory's uid, gid or permission failed, 
   display the invalid value and warning in monit's HTTP interface in 
   red font instead of green and vice versa in case the service will 
   recover. Thanks to Andreas Rust <rust at webnova!de> for reporting 
   the problem.

*  If a checksum test was specified for file, display
   the actual checksum for the monitored file in monit's HTTP interface.
   If a checksum failed event occures, highlight the bad value by red font 
   and display a warning message in the service status field. Thanks to 
   Vlada Macek <tuttle at bbs!fsik!cvut!cz> for reporting the problem.

*  Set content type properly to 'text/xml' for xml output format
   of status page (http://localhost:2812/_status?format=xml). Thanks
   to Vlada Macek <tuttle at bbs!fsik!cvut!cz> for reporting
   the problem.

*  Fixed Solaris 7 autoconf related compilation problem.

*  Fixed FreeBSD compile time warnings and process code.

*  Fixed OpenBSD compile time warnings and process code.

*  Fixed Mac OS X (Darwin) compile time warnings and process code. 
   Thanks to Rick Robino <rrobino at wavedivision!com> for providing 
   access to the platform.

*  Fixes for Sun Forte C compiler support.

*  Fixed compile-time warning for the 64-bit Monit version. Thanks
   to Pavel Urban <urbanp at mlp!cz> for reporting the problem.

*  Minor simplification of internal service control interface.

*  Log the start of Monit http thread each time. During monit
   reload this was not the message related to the http start log entry.

*  In the case that Monit was reloaded and some service was in failed
   state in the same moment, reset the error flag as soon as the service
   will recover after reload. Previous version kept the error flag though
   the service recovered until another failed&succeeded pair occurred.

*  If a service is not monitored, or if a monitored object doesn't exist or 
   the data gathering failed, display the state description in
   different font color and the '-' characters instead of actual service
   parameters' values. The 'not monitored' state has the highest priority
   over errors which the service migth had before monitoring was disabled.

*  If it is not possible to obtain an actual time-stamp for a monitored file
   or a directory, emit data access error event instead of time-stamp failed.

*  ICMP echo test will not skip the testing of ports on a remote host in
   case of failure, because it is possible for an ICMP echo test to fail 
   (for example because of network configuration problem) and the service
   port to still be accessible.

*  Display expected timeout value for port connection test rule in monit
   HTTP interface.

*  Event messages were consolidated to contain the related service name on
   the beginning of the message.

*  Process resource engine was partly rewritten. It includes code clean up
   and separation of output data and data gathering. 

*  Fixed width of html output in monit's http interface.

*  Display device space usage using free blocks for non-superuser in the
   monit's http interface service overview page. Previous versions showed
   correct number, but including space reserved for superuser, which is
   not accessible for normal users.


Version 4.3

NEW FEATURES AND FUNCTIONS:
*  Event engine was refactored. Monit now supports events of
   FAILED and SUCCEEDED types, thus it is able to handle any state
   change. Monit will send alert on recovery by default for
   all event types, except the case, when the monitored service
   doesn't exist or the type of service is invalid - in such case
   will Monit involve service restart by default. Alerts are sent
   once (on state change only). It is possible to optional select
   the action on recovery. General syntax:
     IF rule THEN action [ELSE IF RECOVERED THEN action]

*  Monit now supports variable and constant tests. Constant
   tests are related to failed/succeeded state. Variable tests begins
   with 'IF CHANGED' statement and serves for monitoring of object
   changes. You can use it just for alert or to involve some automatic
   action, as for example to reload monitored process after its
   configuration file was changed. Variable tests are supported for
   'checksum', 'size' and 'timestamp' tests only, if you consider
   that other tests can be useful in variable form too, please let
   us know. 

*  Events generated in the case of error condition changed. Events
   CHANGED, NONEXIST, DATA, EXEC and INVALID were added and it is
   possible to register them in alert statement in addition to
   present alert selectors as usual. Syntax example:
     ALERT foo@bar.baz ON {
       CHANGED, DATA, EXEC, INVALID, NONEXIST, CHECKSUM, ...
     }
   For example in the case that monitored process is not running,
   Monit will generate NONEXIST event. In the case that it is not
   possible to access process' data, Monit will generate DATA event.
   In the case that the execution of start or stop program failed,
   Monit will generate EXEC event. In the case that monitored file
   is not regular file, Monit will generate INVALID event. CHANGED
   event is generated in the case that Monit is configured to watch
   variable object changes (for example configuration file timestamp).

*  Monit now reports action in addition to the event description in
   default alert message format. The action description is accessible
   in mail-format statement via $ACTION token.

*  Monit now reports default actions for failed and recovery states
   of all constant testing rules.

*  Monit now supports START action in addition to previous ALERT,
   RESTART, STOP, EXEC, and UNMONITOR actions.

*  START, STOP, RESTART and UNMONITOR events are deprecated and future
   releases may remove them. They were replaced by new event scheme.
   Usage of these words in 'alert ... on { ...}' statement is possible but
   not recommended anymore. In the case that you need to register just
   subset of alerts for delivery, you need to choose event which is
   corresponding to real cause of the problem (for example event NONEXIST
   for crashed process). START, STOP, RESTART and UNMONITOR are just actions,
   i.e. consequence - not the problem's cause.

BACKWARD INCOMPATIBLE CHANGES:
*  Syntax and behavior of 'checksum' test changed.
   Monit supports two classes of these tests now: either constant or variable.
   Old syntax:
    IF FAILED [hashtype] CHECKSUM [EXPECT STRING] THEN action
   New constant test syntax (behavior backward incompatible):
    IF FAILED [hashtype] CHECKSUM [EXPECT STRING] THEN action
    [ELSE IF RECOVERED THEN action]
   New variable rule syntax:
    IF CHANGED [hashtype] CHECKSUM THEN action
   It affects following construct:
    CHECK FILE httpd.conf WITH PATH /usr/local/apache/conf/httpd.conf
      IF FAILED CHECKSUM THEN EXEC "/usr/local/apache/bin/apachectl graceful"
   In previous Monit version this configuration caused the apache reload
   on monitored configuration file change. Then the value was reseted so
   the test succeeded next cycles until the file was changed again. Refactored
   event engine monitors for checksum value recovery, i.e whether it changed
   to the original value - in such case it will evaluate recovery action,
   otherwise the test keeps failed state. Because the value in this
   usage context will not correspond to the original, Monit will evaluate
   action (reload apache) each cycle until the checksum will recover
   (which is unlikely for configuration file).
   New syntax have to be used for the same result:
    CHECK FILE httpd.conf WITH PATH /usr/local/apache/conf/httpd.conf
      IF CHANGED CHECKSUM THEN EXEC "/usr/local/apache/bin/apachectl graceful"

*  Syntax of one 'size' test form changed. It was unified with new variable
   tests form.
   Deprecated syntax:
    IF SIZE CHANGED THEN action
   New variable rule syntax:
    IF CHANGED SIZE THEN action

*  Syntax of one 'timestamp' test form changed. It was unified with new variable
   tests form.
   Deprecated syntax:
    IF TIMESTAMP CHANGED THEN action
   New variable rule syntax:
    IF CHANGED TIMESTAMP THEN action

BUGFIXES:
*  There was a deadlock possibility caused by race condition in old event
   engine - it was solved within the scope of refactorization.

*  Fix report of remote host test status in text and xml formats and web
   interface output. Thanks to Peter Holdaway <pholdaway!technocom-wireless com>
   for reporting the problem.

*  Using CRLF in the Monit control file created problems during
   parsing. Carriage Return (\r) is now ignored in the monitrc control
   file. Thanks to Michael Shigorin <mike at osdn org ua> for
   reporting and demonstrating the problem.


Version 4.2.1

*  This release patch the following security vulnerability and error,
   reported by "Matthew Murphy" <mattmurphy at kc.rr!com>:
      Error: Possible off-By-One write when handling HTTP POST body
      Vulnerability: Possible buffer overflow in Basic Auth. handling
   The vulnerability exist in previous Monit releases down to the 1.4
   release. This issue affect previous Monit releases if Monit is
   started with http server support.

*  This release also patch a thread race condition that could lead to
   an assert exception. Reported by Peter Holdaway. The problem
   manifested when Monit was asked to start a program that did not
   start (for some reason) and a Monit reload or a Monit exit was
   issued before Poll time had elapsed. This problem will not occur
   during normal usage of monit, where Monit is started and left to
   run by itself.


Version 4.2

NEW FEATURES AND FUNCTIONS:
*  Support for file inclusion in the control file (monitrc).
   Syntax:
     include globstring
   This function allows for the Monit control file to be split up into
   several fragments and (for example) collected into a monitrc.d
   directory. A proof of the concept can be found here:
   http://people.altlinux.ru/~homyakov/packages/monit/

*  Monit now prints its status in text and in xml format via this URL:
   http://localhost:2812/_status?format=xml and
   http://localhost:2812/_status?format=text

*  In addition to MD5 checksums Monit now supports SHA1 checksums for
   files and HTTP requests.

*  Services not monitored does not have their status displayed in the
   web interface, but instead a "not monitored" text is shown.

*  Support for httpd server version signature hiding. Syntax:
     signature [enable|disable]
   By default the Monit httpd server will show its version in the
   header. 

BACKWARD INCOMPATIBLE CHANGES:
*  The old status URL: http://localhost:2812/<service>?action=status
   is defunct and replaced with the new URL described above.

*  The 'monit status' command reports general status overview only and
   status is only available if the Monit daemon runs.

*  Service names in the .monitrc control file is not allowed to start
   with a slash '/', because such service names cannot be viewed
   properly in the Monit web interface.

BUGFIXES:
*  Ring move protection added to process tree code. There was a rare loop
   problem detected which can cause monit's crash. Thanks to Allen Shaw
   <publicnet2!hotmail com> for reporting the problem.

*  Parser fixes to prevent possible crash during configuration phase.

*  Fix invalid monitrc's line number reported when the control file
   parser detected semantical problems (i.e. not syntax problems).
   Thanks to Peter Holdaway <pholdaway!technocom-wireless com> for
   reporting the problem.

*  Also fixed a problem with locked mutex across a fork on Solaris
   (and probably other OS other than Linux v. 2.4 with a "real" thread
   implementation). The problem manifest itself (infrequently) by
   Monit not being able to start a requested program and the forked
   Monit process hanging on a mutex. Thanks to Peter Holdaway
   <pholdaway!technocom-wireless com> for discovering the problem and
   for providing a patch that fixed the problem.

*  The logger is now made thread-safe with a mutex. There existed a
   possibility for two or more threads to write to the log file at the
   same time.

*  Re-added close-on-exec for sockets created by monit, so they will
   not be kept open in processes started by monit. This functionality
   was left out by a mistake in 4.x.

*  Fix exit signal handler race condition.


Version 4.1.1

NEW FEATURES AND FUNCTIONS:
*  Support for global alert statement added. It allows to use definition
   of recipients which are common for all services only once. It is possible
   to use optional custom mailformat and event registration as usual
   in normal (per service) alert statement - the only difference is 'set'
   word on the beginning of this standalone statement. The simplest example:
     set alert sysadmin@bar

*  Monit now print error and log messages to the standard file
   descriptors (1,2) even if they do not referee to a tty. This change
   allows output to be redirected to a non-tty at Monit startup. For
   instance: monit 1>/dev/null 2>/path/monit.err

BUGFIXES:
*  Allow ftp servers to display banners without reporting an error in
   the ftp-protocol test. Thanks to Asaf Shakarchi <asaf!asaf gotdns com> 
   for reporting the problem.

*  The SSH protocol will now send back proper linefeed terminating
   strings to the ssh-server. Thanks to David Fletcher <david!megapico
   co uk> for reporting the problem.

*  This release patch the following security vulnerabilities, reported
   by Evgeny Legerov <e.legerov!s-quadra com>:
      Vulnerability 1: Long http method stack overflow
      Vulnerability 2: Denial of Service via negative Content-Length field
   These vulnerabilities exist in previous Monit releases down to the
   1.4 release. This issue only affect previous Monit releases if
   Monit is started with http server support.


Version 4.1

NEW FEATURES AND FUNCTIONS:
*  Support for ICMP echo test added to remote host check

*  Support for generic protocol tests using send/expect added. It is
   possible to use Posix regex in an expect string if Posix regex is
   supported by the operating system.

*  The number of user credentials is no longer limited to one.

*  Support for htpasswd styled files for user credentials is added.
   Crypt, MD5 and cleartext passwords are supported.

*  From this release on, it is possible to define more than one SMTP
   server Monit should use for sending alert messages. If Monit cannot
   connect to the first SMTP server it will try the second in the list
   and so on.

*  Added SMTP server connect and read timeout. Monit has a default 5
   seconds timeout and if the SMTP server is slow, Monit could timeout
   when connecting or reading from the server. It's is now possible to
   explicit set the timeout to a higher value.

*  Monit can now also test the checksum for files on a remote host via
   the HTTP protocol.

*  Web and console interface output refactored and simplified.
   Instead of printing out one line for each registered alert event-
   type, one condensed line is used.

*  Support for read-only user access added to web interface

*  PHP "proxy" script for accessing the Monit web pages via port 80
   using a regular http server, such as apache httpd. Contributed by
   David Fletcher <david!megapico co uk>. See the contrib/ directory.

BUGFIXES:
*  Alert limitation implemented; Monit will only raise one alert when
   an error situation occurs and *not* repeatedly send error messages
   for the same problem.  When the error has gone, Monit resets and
   will raise a new alert if the error should reoccur. Consider:
     if cpu > 50% then alert
   Monit will now only raise one alert if the cpu usage goes beyond
   50% and, as long as the process uses more than 50% cpu no more
   error alerts are sent. When usage drops below 50% Monit will reset
   and again send a new alert if usage should raise above 50% again.
   Previous versions of Monit did not have this feature and
   continuously sent alerts as long as the test validated to true.
   This change does not only applies to cpu test but also to memory
   tests, size and space tests and timestamp tests. The bottom line is
   that you will no longer get many duplicate alerts for the same
   problem.

*  Don't print html tags to the console on shutdown when Monit runs in
   init mode (-I).

*  Monit now supports logging via multilog when running via
   daemontools. Thanks to Klaus Alexander Seistrup
   <bugs!magnetic-ink.dk> for reporting the problem.

*  Added the resource event type. This type was missing and would lead
   to a parse error if this alert statement was used, 'alert on {
   resource }'

*  Fixed the bug that caused Monit not to unmonitor all depending
   services when a unmonitor action was executed. Thanks to Marco
   Bisioli <bisioli!adriacom.it> for providing the bugfix.

*  Added a missing exec action for space and inode tests

*  Fixed a bug that allowed duplicate entries under certain
   circumstances in the control file.

*  In the case that SSL client certificate is not defined, Monit will
   not print error message


Version 4.0

NEW FEATURES AND FUNCTIONS:
*  A new check service entry was added to allow monitoring of devices.
   In addition to common options Monit is able to watch permission,
   owner's uid and gid, space and inodes and execute customized actions
   in case of a problem. See the manual for the new syntax. Example:
     check device rootfs with path /dev/sda1
           if space usage > 90% then alert
	   alert foo@bar

*  A new check service entry was added to allow monitoring of files. In
   addition to common options, Monit is able to watch checksum, permission,
   owner's uid and gid and file size. See the manual for the new syntax.
   Example:
     check file database with path /data/mydatabase.db
           if size > 100 MB then alert
	   alert foo@bar

*  A new check service entry was added to allow monitoring of directories.
   In addition to common options, Monit is able to watch permission and
   owner's uid and gid. See the manual for the new syntax. Example:
     check directory bin with path /bin
           if failed permission 755 then alert
	   alert foo@bar

*  A new check service entry was added to allow monitoring of remote
   host services. See the manual for the new syntax. Example:
     check host redhat with address ftp.redhat.com
           if failed port 21 protocol ftp then alert
	   alert foo@bar

*  Resource monitoring now checks the number of child processes and
   the total memory of a process and its children.

*  The start and stop statement is extended with an optional part to
   be able to run the program as a specified user and with a specified
   group id. This extension can only be used if the super-user is
   running monit.

*  The timestamp statement is extended to check for file and directory
   changes. You can now use the timestamp statement to get an alert if
   a file was changed. Note: The timestamp does only test the last
   modified stamp not if the content of the file was changed. Use the
   checksum statement for this. Example:
     check file passwd with path /etc/passwd
           if timestamp was changed then alert

*  A new 'exec' action was added for all service test types (such as
   the timestamp, resource, checksum, space, etc.) The exec statement
   is used to execute an arbitrary program as an action if the test
   validates to true. It is possible to run this program optionally as
   a specified user and with a specified group id. See manual for the
   new syntax. For instance to reload apache if the httpd.conf file
   was changed:
     check file httpd.conf with path /usr/local/apache/conf/httpd.conf 
           if timestamp was changed 
              then exec "/etc/init.d/apachectl graceful"

*  A new 'unmonitor' action and command was added to explicit allow
   monitoring disabling. This can be used to disable monitoring of
   services (aka bring it to maintenance mode), etc. Dependency
   relationships are also supported.

*  A new 'monitor' command was added to explicit enable service
   monitoring. This can be used to re-enable monitoring if a service
   timed out or was stopped or start monitoring a service in manual
   mode. Dependency relationships are also supported - all services
   which this service depends on are also set in monitored mode before
   starting monitoring of this service. You can also enable or disable
   service monitoring from the console or from the web interface.

*  It is possible to set message facility in the case that Monit logs
   via syslog.

*  This release supports a native RDATE test. Thanks to Francois
   Isabelle <Francois.Isabelle!ca.kontron.com>

*  This release supports a native RSYNC test. Thanks to Igor
   Homyakov <homyakov!altlinux.ru>

*  Programs executed by monit, now has several Monit specific
   environment variables available, which they may utilize for various
   purposes. A list of the available variables can be found in the
   documentation.

*  Monit can be compiled with dietlibc and uClibc from now on. Using
   dietlibc it possible to use SSL; SSL support with uClibc is
   untested.  For build instructions refer to to the documentation of
   these libraries.

*  Gracefull unbind requests added to LDAPv2 and LDAPv3 tests

*  Monit now reports the complete start/stop command (previous version
   reported only the first argument).

*  Resource monitoring can be turned off in the configure stage of
   compilation.

*  Fixed Monit rc script and monit.spec

*  This release introduces AIX and OpenBSD support and generic 
   support for unknown operating systems. Thanks to Richard
   Schwaninger <risc!vmilch.at> and Margarida Sequeira
   <margarida!openbsd.org>

*  HP/UX support brought to the same state like all other operating 
   systems.

*  The Monit httpd server now logs denied client connections. If a
   client is not allowed to connect to the server the connect attempt
   will be logged including the client's ip-address. A failed attempt
   to log in via basic authentication is also logged with the clients
   ip-address.

*  The Monit httpd server is rewritten to use non-blocking i/o.

BACKWARD INCOMPATIBLE CHANGES:
*  The service names are no longer restricted by reserved names.
   Due to this, the syntax of DEPENDS was changed.

*  The syntax of resource monitoring has changed. "CPUUSAGE",
   "MEMUSAGE", "MEMKBYTE" is dropped in favor of the unit based
   "MEM" and "CPU" commands.  Please consult the man page for 
   details.

*  The syntax for the checksum statement has changed so the statement
   is a real IF-THEN statement. An example of a valid checksum
   statement: "if failed checksum then stop". The old syntax version
   is obsolete.

*  The syntax for the timeout statement has changed so the statement
   is a real IF-THEN statement. An example of a valid timeout
   statement is:
     if 2 restarts within 3 cycles then timeout
   The old syntax version, e.g. timeout(2, 3) still works but is
   deprecated and future releases may remove this version.

*  This release changes the port statement to explicit require an
   action to be executed upon a failed connection test. The port
   statement has also been extended to include an optional socket
   connection timeout.

*  The checksum statement is now restricted to a check file service
   entry. Usage of this statement in a check process service is
   obsolete from this release. See the documentation and the
   UPGRADE.txt file accompanying the software.

*  The timestamp statement is now restricted to a check file service
   entry. Usage of this statement in a check process service is
   obsolete from this release. See the documentation and the
   UPGRADE.txt file accompanying the software.

*  You do not need to specify the path to the file or directory in a
   checksum or in a timestamp statements. The path is inherited from
   the parent check service.  See the documentation and UPGRADE.txt
   file.

*  The command line arguments start, stop and restart needs a
   following 'all' from this release on to start/stop/restart *all*
   programs in the control file. For instance 'monit stop all'. This
   is done to avoid that an accidentally user input error should stop
   every monitored service at once.
   
*  The $PROGRAM tag in the mail-format statement was renamed to
   $SERVICE. The meaning is the same - it is replaced by the name of
   the monitored service, but compared to previous versions these
   services can now be either program, device, directory or file. The
   $PROGRAM tag is still supported for backward compatibility, but use
   of $SERVICE is highly recommended because it is more relevant.

*  The option -i was removed because it was useless. Note: option
   -I which is used for Monit starting under init's control is not
   affected by this change.

BUGFIXES:
*  Monit now closes all file descriptors before spawning a child
   processes. There was a problem with open file descriptors inherited
   by processes started under monit's control. Thanks to Peter
   Holdaway <pholdaway!technocom-wireless.com> for reporting the
   problem.

*  This release fixes a problem with alert messages and qmail. Qmail
   complained about bare line feeds in some alert messages. Monit does
   not send alert message with bare line feeds anymore. Thanks to Rail
   Aliev <rail!iqchoice.com>

*  Fixed the bug that did not report actions on a service unless a
   start statement was defined for the service. Now it is possible get
   notification via email if a service died, even if you did not
   include any start statement. For instance, this is now a complete
   statement and will, report if the service apache should die: 
    check process apache with pidfile /usr/local/apache/logs/httpd.pid
    alert foo@bar.baz

*  Fixed a bug in the lexer that required the start and stop statement
   to use SPACE '=' "/<path> argument" when arguments was used. The
   start and stop statement can now be written as: 
     start "/<path>/program start" if you want to.

*  Checksum statement bug fix. Previous versions compared only
   first 31 characters of 32 possible.

*  This release utilize a state file to save significant process data.
   This allows data to be persistent and survive a Monit reload and
   let Monit recover from a crash and pick up without losing the
   process state.

*  The network code was rewritten to use a more modern non-blocing
   approach. As a result, socket read/write and socket connection
   works more proper and allows configured timeout.

*  Race conditions created by signaling the executable at the wrong
   time and at the wrong place could lead to SIGSEGV. This has been
   fixed and cleaned up by introducing (more) thread blocks in the
   code, thus making the code more reentrant.

*  Fixed the problem, where Monit identified a running process as non-
   running. Thanks to Shannon E. Reall <ser!ams.org> for reporting the
   problem.

*  Monit does not use /proc/kcore on Linux anymore. This makes it
   possible to use Monit on a 2.4 kernel with the grsecurity patch and
   on a 2.6 kernel with architectures such as ARM. Thanks to Arkadiusz
   Miskiewicz <arekm!pld-linux.org> for reporting the problem and
   providing the patch.

*  Fixed race condition related to Monit httpd server stop. Monit now
   waits for its httpd to terminate gracefully before freeing memory
   and closing filedescriptors.

*  Fixed race condition related to SIGINT and SIGTERM signals which
   if catched during Monit exit phase can cause recurrent exit handler
   call.

*  Don't try to stop Monit httpd and close daemon related files if monit
   was not started in daemon mode and received SIGTERM or SIGINT.


Version 3.2

*  This release include documentation on how to setup a simple
   failsafe cluster with Monit and Heartbeat, see also:
   http://www.tildeslash.com/monit/monit.html#monit%20with%20heartbeat
   Thanks to Oliver Jehle <oliver.jehle!monex.li>.

*  Monit now reloads configuration ONLY after it receives SIGHUP.
   Automatic reload based on monit's control file timestamp is now
   defunct.

*  New Monit command 'reload' is added. If used, it will reinitialize
   a running Monit daemon (send it the SIGHUP signal).

*  A new Monit option '-t' is added. If used, Monit will run a syntax
   check for the control file and exit with the status.

*  The ssl version for TCPSSL tests can now explicitly be set if auto-
   detection should fail. (Thanks to Mark Foster <mdf!foster.cc> for
   the bug report)

*  This release supports a native LDAPv2 and LDAPv3 tests. Both tests
   are based on anonymous bind.

*  This release supports a native DWP (database wire protocol) test.

*  Restart method added to Monit httpd cervlet

*  HP/UX support was added. Thanks to Joe Bryant <JBryant!RiteAid.com>.

*  Monit now reports service monitoring status [monitored|not monitored].
   Thanks to Oliver Jehle <oliver.jehle!monex.li>.

*  Daylight savings time calculation problem fixed

*  Alert messages in passive mode fixed

*  Console command "monit restart [service]" in daemon mode fixed

*  Start/stop/restart race condition fixed.


Version 3.1

*  This release optionally makes use of openssl. It is possible to
   monitor processes which are forged with ssl. Monit's http server
   can run with ssl, too. Read more about this feature in the man
   documentation and in the file, README.SSL. The SSL feature is a
   beta feature in this release.

*  This release supports process dependency. This is a beta feature.

*  This release replaces the 'autostart' statement with the 'mode'
   keyword. 'autostart' is now deprecated.

*  Three monitoring modes are now supported. In addition to the
   standard active mode (equals obsolete autostart=yes) and passive
   mode (equals obsolete autostart=no) there is a new manual mode,
   which allows Monit to work as a simple process monitor in a
   clustered environment. Thanks to Oliver Jehle
   <oliver.jehle!monex.li> for the proposal and helping with the
   patch.

*  The location of the pidfile can be modified via a command switch or
   in the control file using the new 'set pidfile' statement.

*  This release supports a native ssh protocol test. Thanks to
   Igor Homyakov <homyakov!altlinux.ru>.

*  This release supports timestamp monitoring for files and for
   directories.

*  If start and/or stop programs are not defined, Monit will act as in
   passive mode, that is, Monit will send alert message in case of
   service failure. Previous release did nothing in such cases.

*  This release reloads Monit httpd if the interface where Monit httpd
   listens for connection was changed in monitrc (don't require
   monit's restart)

*  If a SIGHUP signal is sent to a Monit daemon it will reload
   itself. This is useful if you use a Monit log file and need to
   rotate the log, for instance with the logrotate program.


Version 3.0

*  A new feature to check and utilize systems and process information
   is introduced with this release. With this feature you can get an
   alert or Monit will stop or restart programs based on their process
   characteristic. E.g. if a process is using too much memory you can
   get an alert, or if a process is using too much CPU Monit can auto-
   matically restart the program. Please have a look in the document-
   ation to learn more about this new feature.

*  This release also augment the web interface and console status
   command to display for each process the uptime, cpu usage and
   memory usage.

*  To protect the security of your control file and passwords the
   control file must have permissions no more than 0700 (u=xrw,g=,o=);
   Monit will complain and exit otherwise.

*  This release support up to 64 arguments for the start and stop
   programs. Previous versions supported only 2 arguments.

*  If Monit fails to execute a start or stop program, Monit will now
   send an alert message. Previously, Monit only logged a message if
   it failed to execute a program.

*  This release makes use of autoheader and config.h. Thanks to Mark
   Ferlatte <ferlatte!cryptio.net>.
