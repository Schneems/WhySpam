			<h2><b>Custom Surveys</b></h2>
			<p>Ever want to ask a user who didn't like your service why? Well with our custom survey integration you can get direct access to the people who don't like your email campaigns. As users delete email addresses we can ask them to submit an optional survey with your custom feedback questions. Our users have already used your service, received email from you, and want to be heard. So don't let their voices fall on deaf ears, improve your email presence  </p>
