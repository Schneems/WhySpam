	<h4>What is WhySpam™ Secure Forms?</h4>
	<p>
	A WhySpam™ Secure Form lets you keep your email away from all those nasty spam-bots while giving everyone else a way to keep in-touch. Instead of posting your email address out there on the web for anyone to see, we'll give you a link that you can give out instead.
	When someone clicks on the link, they'll get a form they can fill out to send you an email. This way you get your email, without ever having to give out your email address. When your done with the link, you can cancel your form any time. 
	 <br />
	 <br />
		<%= link_to "We will never sell your personal email or give out your personal information.", {:action => "privacy", :controller => "users"}, {:rel => "prettyPopin" } %>
